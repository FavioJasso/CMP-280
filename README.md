# CMP-280

## Description of CMP - 280: 

Software engineering practices are examined in the context of the system development life cycle, comparing traditional structured approach and the object-oriented approach, with the main focus on object-oriented approach. Topics include user stories, use cases, object-oriented modeling, comprehensive project management, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, Agile techniques, and user-interface design. Class projects provide students with practice in developing soft skills necessary to work as part of a team. Students participate in a semester-long team project to design an application using system analysis and design techniques.

Simulating a true work environment, students work together on team, specifying project plans, requirements, and system design using Slack, GitHub, MS Visio/Draw.io, MS Project and Trello, and participating in formal document inspections. Teams will design a mobile app from planning through design phases.
